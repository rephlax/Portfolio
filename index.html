                            Luke Farrell, a graduate of De Montfort University, earned a degree in Music Technology. Although he initially pursued a path in music technology, his experiences in the industry made him realize it wasn't the right fit.

As he navigated the hotel's sophisticated technological systems and interacted with guests, Luke found himself drawn to the broader world of technology. These experiences ignited his desire to explore different aspects of the field, leading him to make a decisive shift toward a career in web development.
